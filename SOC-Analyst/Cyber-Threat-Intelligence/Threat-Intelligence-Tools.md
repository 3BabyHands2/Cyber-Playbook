# Threat Intelligence Tools

***UrlScan.io***
https://urlscan.io/
- Used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions
- Scan Results:
  - Summary: Provides general information about the URL, ranging from the identified IP address, domain registration details, page history and a screenshot of the site.
  - HTTP: Provides information on the HTTP connections made by the scanner to the site, with details about the data fetched and the file types received.
  - Redirects: Shows information on any identified HTTP and client-side redirects on the site.
  - Links: Shows all the identified links outgoing from the site's homepage.
  - Behaviour: Provides details of the variables and cookies found on the site. These may be useful in identifying the frameworks used in developing the site.
  - Indicators: Lists all IPs, domains and hashes associated with the site. These indicators do not imply malicious activity related to the site.
 
***Abuse.ch***
https://abuse.ch/
- Identify and track malware and botnets through these platforms:
  - Malware Bazaar:  A resource for sharing malware samples.
  - Feodo Tracker:  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
  - SSL Blacklist:  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
  - URL Haus:  A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
  - Threat Fox:  A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).
 
*MalwareBazaar*
https://bazaar.abuse.ch/
- Malware Samples Upload: Security analysts can upload their malware samples for analysis and build the intelligence database. This can be done through the browser or an API.
- Malware Hunting: Hunting for malware samples is possible through setting up alerts to match various elements such as tags, signatures, YARA rules, ClamAV signatures and vendor detection.

*FeodoTracker*
https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/
- Share intelligence on botnet Command & Control (C&C) servers associated with:
  - Dridex
  - Emotes (aka Heodo)
  - TrickBot
  - QakBot
  - BazarLoader/BazarBackdoor
- Additionally provides:
  - IP blocklists and mitigation information (prevent botnet infections)
  - IOC blocklists and mitigation information (prevent botnet infections)
 
*SSL Blacklist*
https://sslbl.abuse.ch/
- Tool to identify and detect malicious SSL connections
- Denylist is also used to identify JA3 fingerprints that would help detect and block malware botnet C2 communications on the TCP layer

*URLhaus*
https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/
- Tool focuses on sharing malicious URLs used for malware distribution
- Database for domains, URLs, hashes and filetypes
- Provides feeds associated with country, AS number and Top Level Domain

*ThreatFox*
https://threatfox.abuse.ch/
- Search for, share and export indicators of compromise associated with malware

***PhishTool***
https://www.phishtool.com/
- *Core Features*
  - Perform email analysis: PhishTool retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities to follow the emailâ€™s actions, attachments, and URLs to triage the situation.
  - Heuristic intelligence: OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a target.
  - Classification and reporting: Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be shared.

- *Additional Features*
  - Manage user-reported phishing events.
  - Report phishing email findings back to users and keep them engaged in the process.
  - Email stack integration with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.

- *Analysis Tab*
  - Headers: Provides the routing information of the email, such as source and destination email addresses, Originating IP and DNS addresses and Timestamp.
  - Received Lines: Details on the email traversal process across various SMTP servers for tracing purposes.
  - X-headers: These are extension headers added by the recipient mailbox to provide additional information about the email.
  - Security: Details on email security frameworks and policies such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC).
  - Attachments: Lists any file attachments found in the email.
  - Message URLs: Associated external URLs found in the email will be found here.
