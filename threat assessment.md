# Threat Assessment

## Risk Domain: People

**1. Social Engineering:**
- **Vulnerability:** Employees are vulnerable to social engineering attacks due to excessive trust and lack of verification processes.
- **Mitigation:** Employees must be trained to recognize and respond to social engineering attempts and strictly follow verification procedures to prevent breaches.

**2. Insider Threats:**
- **Vulnerability:** Insider threat incidents may occur when employees unintentionally leak sensitive information, putting the organization at risk.
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive training on organizational policies is essential to ensure that employees do not inadvertently cause security incidents.

## Risk Domain: Process

**1. Weak Authentication Practices:**
- **Vulnerability:** Weak password policies can lead to compromised accounts, especially if passwords are easily crackable.
- **Mitigation:** Implement password policies that enforce strong length and complexity requirements to enhance organizational security.

**2. Poor Incident Response Time:**
- **Vulnerability:** Delayed incident response can exacerbate the damage caused by breaches or attacks.
- **Mitigation:** Develop and maintain Incident Response Plans (IRPs) to ensure swift and effective responses to potential security incidents.

## Risk Domain: Technology

**1. Principle of Least Privilege:**
- **Vulnerability:** Granting excessive access to employees increases the risk of an attack spreading if an account is compromised.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure that employees only have access to the applications and information necessary for their roles.

**2. Outdated Systems:**
- **Vulnerability:** Outdated systems are vulnerable to attacks due to the lack of security patches once they reach end-of-life support.
- **Mitigation:** Regularly update systems and migrate to newer, supported platforms to ensure continued security.

# Implementation Approach

## Addressing Social Engineering & Insider Threats

**Control:** Implement employee awareness and training programs.
- **Description:** Educate employees on recognizing and resisting social engineering tactics and understanding security policies to reduce the risk of insider threats.
- **Additional Measure:** Conduct background checks during recruitment to identify potential insider threats.

## Improving Authentication Practices & Incident Response

**Control:** Establish strong password policies and Incident Response Plans (IRPs).
- **Description:** Enforce password policies that require sufficient length and complexity to mitigate the risk of password cracking. Develop and regularly update IRPs to ensure quick and effective responses to incidents.

## Enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege & Updating Systems

**Control:** Implement the principle of least privilege and ensure systems are up-to-date.
- **Description:** Limit access to applications and data based on role-specific needs to minimize the impact of potential breaches. Regularly update or replace outdated systems to protect against vulnerabilities.
