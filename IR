# Asset Investigation

## Computers

Relevance: Computers are crucial assets in the investigation due to the high probability of valuable data stored on them.
Potential Evidence: Deep searches through the hard drives may uncover stolen credit card information, transaction records, and other potentially incriminating data.
Networking Equipment

Relevance: Networking equipment used to intercept wireless communications and break into networks is another significant asset.
Potential Evidence: This equipment could provide insights into the networks that were accessed, and how adversaries used high-powered antennas to steal information. (Vijayan, 2009)
Evidence Collection Tools
Autopsy and The Sleuth Kit

Functionality: The Sleuth Kit is a command-line tool that performs forensic analysis on forensic images of hard drives and smartphones. (Poston, 2021)
Use Case: Ideal for deep forensic analysis after imaging.
FTK Imager

Functionality: FTK Imager is used to create disk images, which can then be analyzed using Autopsy or The Sleuth Kit, as Autopsy lacks image creation functionality. (Poston, 2021)
Chain of Custody
Documentation: Record the date, time, and location whenever evidence is collected. Ensure that all individuals involved in handling the evidence are documented to maintain a clear and comprehensive chain of custody.
Labeling: Properly label and seal all evidence to prevent tampering.
Storage: Store evidence in a secure location and log every access to ensure integrity.
Transfer Protocols: Document every detail during evidence transfer, including the individuals involved, the method of transfer, and the reasons for transfer.
Proactive Approaches
Systems Thinking Mindset

Importance: A systems thinking approach is essential during investigations to understand how different parts of a system interact with each other.
Data Integrity

Court Cases: Maintaining data integrity is crucial for ensuring that evidence is reliable and unaltered, which is necessary for it to be considered valid in court.
Non-Court Cases: Even in non-court cases, credibility and trustworthiness of data are paramount. Untrustworthy data can undermine the entire investigation.
Chain of Custody

Concept: The chain of custody involves comprehensive documentation of every step taken with evidenceâ€”from handling and storage to transfer. This practice ensures the integrity of the evidence and compliance with legal standards, while also establishing accountability.
